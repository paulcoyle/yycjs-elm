# Intro to Functional Programming with Elm - YYC.js

This is the companion set of code used in the YYC.js talk given on April 19,
2016 by @mch and @paulcoyle.  Each stage of the presentation is tagged so you
can check out at those particular commits with:

    git checkout tags/stage-<number>

You can see a list of all tagged stages with:

    git tag -l


## Requirements

You'll want to install the [Elm language and tools](http://elm-lang.org/install),
version 0.16 or later.  Some stages may make use of Node.js and NPM which come
together in the [Node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/).
